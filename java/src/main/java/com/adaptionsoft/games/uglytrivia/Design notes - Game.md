# Design Notes
Game
- there must be at least 2 players but no more than 6
- There are 50 questions for pop, science, sports, and rock
- Each trivia question is only used once
- players take turns in order
- play advances to next player whether right or wrong
- player wins if their purse contains 6 gold coins
- purse represents gold coins
- player gets a gold coin when answering correctly
- player is put in a penalty box if they answer wrong,
  - tracked by inPenaltyBox
  - still keep same place on board
- places represents the board
  - 0, 4, 8 are pop
  - 1, 5, 9 are science
  - 2, 6, 10 are sports
  - 3, 7 are rock
  - 11 is also rock
  - board wraps back to 0 if you go past 11.
- Players move the amount rolled, then answer a question for the place they land
- player misses a turn if they are in the penalty box on an even roll
- player leaves penalty box on an odd roll and advances to new position on the board
## Design issues
- Check for >= 2 players isn't used
- Not handled if you run out of question cards for a category
- Tracks player state in separate array[6] primitives as well as list
- Uses LinkedList instead of List/ArrayList
- Maximum of 6 players?
- returns notAWinner instead winner making code hard to understand
- some methods use vars named winner to represent notAWinner
- isGettingOutOfPenaltyBox tracks only one state but used for all six players
  - set in roll() but used in wasCorrectlyAnswered
- "corrent" is misspelled in one place.
- ## Testing issues
- outputs to System.out
- "corrent" is misspelled in one place.
